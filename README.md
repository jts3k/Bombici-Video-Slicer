# Bombici Video Slicer

A [max patch](http:cycling74.com) that slices up a bunch of videos vertically and moves the slices around the screen at frequencies that are all integer multiples of one another, in other words they are moving at speeds derived from the harmonic series, which causes cool visual shit to happen.  Created by [Jesse Stiles](http:jessestil.es) on behalf of the music group [Bombici](https://www.facebook.com/bombici/) to make [this music video](https://youtu.be/KYzGaUQjduw).
